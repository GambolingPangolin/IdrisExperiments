# Experimenting with Idris

[Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) is a language with support for dependent types.  

* I thought it would be interesting to play around with it so I implemented a type `Ord a => SortedList a` which represents lists where the elements occur in increasing order.  

* At the suggestion of David Christiansen, I solved a few exercises on the notion of a view.
